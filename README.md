# GDAL-tutorial
Tutorial of GDAL and Python for geospatial data analysis. This tutorial will focus on reading raster image from Landsat 8, viewing its properties, viewing the bands and generating color composites. Basic calculations on the raster will also be attempted in the form of generating an NDVI image and generating a vegetation mask via thresholding. The data for this tutorial will temporarily employ the Landsat data uploaded by CE Holden. I am in the process of modifying my present tutorial for use with Indian datasets.
