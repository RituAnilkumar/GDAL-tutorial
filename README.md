# GDAL-tutorial
Tutorial of GDAL and Python for geospatial data analysis. This tutorial will focus on reading raster image from Landsat 8, viewing its properties, viewing the bands and generating color composites. Basic calculations on the raster will also be attempted in the form of generating an NDVI image and generating a vegetation mask via thresholding. We will also attempt reclassifying it to get classes based on NDVI thresholding.
